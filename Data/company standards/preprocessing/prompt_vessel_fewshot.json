The 'Item' is the main subject or entity, the 'Property' is a characteristic or attribute of the item, and the 'Value' is the specific detail or measurement related to the property. Provide the answer in the following format:\n\n1. Item: [Extracted Item]\n2. Property: [Extracted Property]\n3. Value: [Extracted Value]\n\n**Examples:**\nSentence: For Helico-Axial Multiphase pumps, higher head can be achieved by different hydraulics or by changing speed with the variable speed driver.\nOutput:\n1. Item: Helico-Axial Multiphase pumps\n2. Property: Head\n3. Value: Higher possible via different hydraulics/speed\n\nSentence: When the first stage impeller eye peripheral velocity is in excess of 70 m/s (230 ft/sec), the pump shall be free of cavitation;\nOutput:\n1. Item: First stage impeller\n2. Property: Cavitation \n3. Value: Free above 70 m/s (230 ft/sec) of the first stage impeller eye peripheral velocity.\n\nSentence:Visualization test is required for water injection pumps when the first stage impeller eye peripheral velocity exceeds 47 m/sec (154 ft/sec).\nOutput:\n1. Item: First stage impeller\n2. Property: Visualization test\n3. Value: Required for exceeding 47 m/sec (154 ft/sec) of eye Peripheral velocity.\n\nSentence: For all pumps with the exception of Helico-Axial Multiphase pumps, the Vendor shall indicate on the pump performance curve, the NPSH3 curve for 3% reduction of the first stage differential head.\nOutput:\n1. Item: All pumps (except Helico-Axial Multiphase pumps)\n2. Property: NPSH3 curve\n3. Value: Indicate for 3% reduction of the first stage differential head\n\nOnly answer the last sentence in the passage and follow the correct format. Do not add anything else",
    "input": "Stress analysis due to piping, equipment, lifting, supports and other external loads shall be completed in accordance with the procedures as detailed in WRC 537, WRC 297 or a finite element analysis.",
    "output": "1. Item: (Vessels)\n2. Property: Stress analysis due to piping, equipment, lifting, supports and other external loads\n3. Value: shall be completed in accordance with the procedures as detailed in WRC 537, WRC 297 or a finite element analysis"
