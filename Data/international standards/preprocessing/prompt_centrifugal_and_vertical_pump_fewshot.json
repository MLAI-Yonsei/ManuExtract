    "instruction": "Given a sentence, extract the 'Item', 'Property', and 'Value'. The 'Item' is the main subject or entity, the 'Property' is a characteristic or attribute of the item, and the 'Value' is the specific detail or measurement related to the property. Provide the answer in the following format:\n\n1. Item: [Extracted Item]\n2. Property: [Extracted Property]\n3. Value: [Extracted Value]\n\n**Examples:**\nSentence: For Helico-Axial Multiphase pumps, higher head can be achieved by different hydraulics or by changing speed with the variable speed driver.\nOutput:\n1. Item: Helico-Axial Multiphase pumps\n2. Property: Head\n3. Value: Higher possible via different hydraulics/speed\n\nSentence: When the first stage impeller eye peripheral velocity is in excess of 70 m/s (230 ft/sec), the pump shall be free of cavitation;\nOutput:\n1. Item: First stage impeller\n2. Property: Cavitation \n3. Value: Free above 70 m/s (230 ft/sec) of the first stage impeller eye peripheral velocity.\n\nSentence:  6.1.1 All pressure vessels, including unfired steam drums, shall be mechanically designed in accordance with ASME SEC VIII D1 or ASME SEC VIII D2 (herein referred to as the Codes), and the requirements of 32-SAMSS-004 or 32-SAMSS-036 and, as applicable, 32-SAMSS-031.\nOutput:\n1.
