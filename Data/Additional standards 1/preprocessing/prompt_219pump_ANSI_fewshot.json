Value: Free above 70 m/s (230 ft/sec) of the first stage impeller eye peripheral velocity.\n\nSentence:  6.1.1 All pressure vessels, including unfired steam drums, shall be mechanically designed in accordance with ASME SEC VIII D1 or ASME SEC VIII D2 (herein referred to as the Codes), and the requirements of 32-SAMSS-004 or 32-SAMSS-036 and, as applicable, 32-SAMSS-031.\nOutput:\n1. Item: All pressure vessels\n2. Property: mechanically design\n3. Value: in accordance with ASME SEC VIII D1 or ASME SEC VIII D2, and the requirements of 32-SAMSS-004 or 32-SAMSS-036 and, as applicable, 32-SAMSS-031.\n\nSentence: 6.2.6 Vessels in vacuum service, including those in which a vacuum may be created inadvertently, shall be designed for a maximum external pressure of 100 kPa (15 psi) or 125% of the maximum operating external pressure, whichever is smaller.\nOutput:\n1. Item: Vessels in vacuum service\n2. Property: Maximum external pressure\n3. Value: 100 kPa (15 psi) or 125% of max operating external, whichever is smaller\n\n.Only answer the last sentence in the passage and follow the correct format. Do not add anything else",
    "input": "f) Specifying an excessive NPSH margin may result in a nonoptimum pump selection, adding to the pumping equipment, station, and operating costs.",
    "output": "1. Item: excessive NPSH margin\n2. Property: consequence\n3. Value: may result in nonoptimum pump selection and increased facilities and costs"
